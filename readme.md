## Research Project
### Analysis of Soccer Movement Model Based on Sensor Data

Undergraduate Research Training, Independent Research. Advisor: Prof. Xi Chen

* Used Nine-axis sensor to collect the training movement data of the school soccer team.
* Partitioned the multi-dimensional time series data with stochastic sampling methods.
* Used Gradient Boost Decision Tree, CNN and Bi-LSTM model to capture the statistical patterns of the movements
* Recognized and classified the actions such as turning, passing, running and shooting, which can monitor the movement of players during the race.
